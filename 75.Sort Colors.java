/*
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
